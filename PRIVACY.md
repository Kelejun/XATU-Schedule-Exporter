# Privacy Policy for XATU Schedule Exporter

**Last Updated:** 2024-01-14

## 1. Data Collection
The "XATU Schedule Exporter" extension is designed with privacy as a priority. 
- **We do not collect any personal data.** 
- **We do not transmit any data to external servers.**

## 2. Data Usage
The extension operates entirely locally within your browser context:
- It reads the course schedule HTML content displayed on `jwgl2018.xatu.edu.cn`.
- It parses this text to generate a standard calendar file format (`.ics`).
- This generated file is downloaded directly to your device.
- At no point is your schedule information sent to the developer or any third parties.

## 3. Permissions
The extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:
- **Host Permission (`jwgl2018.xatu.edu.cn`)**: Required to detect and read the schedule table on the university's website.
- **Active Tab / Scripting**: Required to inject the parsing logic and the "Export" button into the page.

## 4. Contact
If you have any questions about this privacy policy, please contact the developer via the GitHub repository or the store support page.
